## Motivation

I was looking for a simple ChatGpt client I could use with gtp-3.5-turbo. I prefered flask because it's simple to use and run for experimental purposes.

I also wanted to test out chat-gpt. It wrote 90% of the code in response to my questions.

## Known Issues

After around 20-30 messages OpenApi will timeout. This seems to be due to the openai library doing something odd. Use the reset button to start over.
